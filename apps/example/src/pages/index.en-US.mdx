`react-image-previewer` has an unparalleled preview interaction experience: starting from the opening of the image, the animation, details and interaction of each frame have been carefully designed and repeatedly debugged, which is comparable to the effect of native image preview.

## Overview

```jsx
import { PhotoProvider, PhotoView } from 'react-image-previewer';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <PhotoProvider>
      <PhotoView src="/1.jpg">
        <img src="/1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
      </PhotoView>
    </PhotoProvider>
  );
}
```

In this example, `react-image-previewer` provides two components: `PhotoProvider` and `PhotoView`. With the `PhotoProvider` as the boundary, all the `PhotoView` images in it will be extracted as a set of image preview galleries in the running order. When an `<img >` is clicked, it will locate the specified image and open the preview.

  Note: Basic usage will not carry any toolbar UI and buttons.

## Toolbar related UI

`react-image-previewer` provides two complete sets of toolbar UI components, which can be imported by `react-image-previewer/ui`.

Arbitrary overlays can be rendered using the `overlayRender` property. For example, we can use `SlideToolbar` and `CloseButton` to implement a simple toolbar.

[More UI configuration](/docs/getting-started#ui)

```js
import { PhotoProvider, PhotoView } from 'react-image-previewer';
import { SlideToolbar, CloseButton } from 'react-image-previewer/ui';

function App() {
  return (
    <PhotoProvider overlayRender={props => {
        const { onClose } = props
        return (
          <>
            <SlideToolbar {...props} />
            <CloseButton onClick={onClose} />
          </>
        )
      }}>
      <PhotoView src="/1.jpg">
        <img src="/1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
      </PhotoView>
    </PhotoProvider>
  );
}
```
